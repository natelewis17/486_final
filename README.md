# 486_final

This is the GitHub Repository for my final mini-project for STAT 486. This project will explore using machine learning methods to make predictions on the sales of video games. It will also explore which features are the most important for making these predictions.

This Repo Contains:
* All of the code I used to complete this project (final_code.ipynb)
* My report summarizing the findings of my project (final_report.pdf)
* The CSV containing the data I used. I got the CSV from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) user Rush Kirubi's posted dataset. The data comes originally from Vghhartz and Metacritic.
